## Zalon Growth day

* Features selection is important more than algorithms
* Deep learning kind of learns best features
* biggest challenges is finding enough unbiased data The slides used for the first part of the presentation:

### yufeng guo The 7 steps of Machine learning

* randomisation of data
* split data into training and testing
* how big data is enough ? how to determine when your data is not enough is it by model performance ? and would you try
  out different models till you get good performance ?
* choosing a model (for images , for text etc)
* parameter tuning

### Supervised learning vs unsupervised learning vs Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning , learning by feedback program learns by playing game millions of times, (x / o ) example
learning by trial and error through reward or punishment works best in games where you see everything sampling x known
points close by (k nearest neighbour)
