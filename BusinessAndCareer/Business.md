* Here are our top picks for PayPal alternatives based on Alexa rankings:
* AlertPay: Ranks 6,948, which is up nearly double from February 2008. Our top choice for the most viable alternative to
  eBay -- a secure and fast way to pay online.
* Moneybookers: Ranks 4,739. With high ranking and 2,050+
* organizations linking to it, so moneybookers.com must be popular!
* RevolutionMoneyExchange: Long name, but a nice interface, and excellent viral marketing program. They give you \$25 to
  open an account and \$10 for each person you refer (up to \$500). Ranks 72,666 (up from February ranking of 254,063).
* TrialPay: Ranks 4,965. This payment processing solution offers shoppers free product from blue chip companies;
  apparently it's notviable for small end companies to participate.
* OBOPAY: Ranks 169,025. Great user interface, marketing
* themselves as the PayPal alternative. They pay you \$10 to join! Not available to Virginia residents. Requires a
  mobile telephone number.
* E-Gold: Ranks 5,972. This one's backed by gold (or silver, platinum or palladium)! Best of all, payment is immediate
  and there are no chargebacks - you get paid and stay paid!
* PayMate: Ranks 918,688. Clever name for Australian site (works for New Zealanders, too.)
* Allpay Ranks 1,512,487. It's the U.K.'s only payment solution that's also used throughout Europe as well as the United
  States.
* XOOM: Ranks 25,480. This money transfer service accepts funds from major credit cards, your bank account or PayPal.
  Can't figure out why anyone would use PayPal to fund a XOOM money transfer.
* Interac: Ranks 432,349. Available only in Canada, this e-mail money transfer transaction is like sending cash and
  cannot be reversed. The only thing they protect is your financial information.
* checkfree: Ranks 238,281. Helps you pay bills online. This is merchant account, so you can use it on eBay, but it's
  not really a viable PayPal alternative.
* FirePay: Ranks 439,549. With virtually no user interface explaining the site, it's unwelcoming to new users.
* BidPay: Still ranks 457,897. Had a loyal following, but closed operations December 31, 2007.
* Alexa rankings performed April 6, 2008.
