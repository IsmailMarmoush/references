# Graphql

* Defining a schema programmatically or through IDL interface definition language

## Lessons from 4 years of Graphql

* Naming is important
* No breaking changes
* Think in graphs not in endpoints
* Single cohesive graph
* API not tied to mobile or web etc
* What happens when implementing changes ?
* Would new engine understand this
* what might version 2 look like
* will this work for future clients
* have a consumer
* Designer -> editor
* Do not opensource too early

### Pros

* Low network overhead
* Typed schema
* Fits graph like data verywell

### Cons

* Complexity
* Caching might be a problem
* Versioning
* Still, early technology
