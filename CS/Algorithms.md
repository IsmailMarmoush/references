# Big O Notation (Time/Space)

* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/plain-english-explanation-of-big-o/487278#487278
* https://justin.abrah.ms/computer-science/big-o-notation-explained.html
* https://justin.abrah.ms/computer-science/how-to-calculate-big-o.html
* Drop constants 2N is N
* Ordered pair (A*B) unless both equal length then it's N^2
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgeJmTKQlKs&list=PLpPXw4zFa0uKKhaSz87IowJnOTzh9tiBk&index=2
    * drop all constants
    * ignore lower order terms  (x^3 + x^2 + x + 3) =>  x^3
    * ignore the base of logs
        * math.log(n) is ln(n) to get the log10(n)  then log10(n) = ln(n)/ln(10)
* Big O - same or faster
* Small o - faster
* Theta - same rate
* Big Omega - same or slower
* Small Omega - slower

# Algorithms Notes

# Big O

* Big O is upper bound academically
* Big Omega is the lower bound
* Big (0) theta is both Upper and lower bound, and Big O became Big theta usually in interviews

# Checklist

* How to implement iterators
* Search
* binary search
* how hashes work,
* know how to traverse a graph (either BFS or DFS),
* how to do recursions.
* Sorting
* have your sorts down, quick, bucket sorts, randomized quicksort, heap sort, radix sort, spanning tree, minimum cuts as
  well.
* Trie
* Study trie, heap, set, red-black trees,
* ~~Dynamic programming, (saving fibonacci results)~~

# Solving algorithm problem

## Steps:

* Read, listen carefuly
* Draw an example
* State a brute force
* Optimize
* Walk through
* Implement
* Test

## Methodologies

* BUD -> Bottlenecks, unnecessary work, duplicates
* DIY -> Do it yourself, visualize how you'd do it manually
* Simplify and generalize
* Base case and build
    * permutation of 2 elements then 3
* data structure brain storm
    * weigh differences between data structures
* Examples to rule
    * Couple of examples ->> General rule, as in a mathematics functions
* Pattern matching
    * consider if problem is similar to another problem
* Simplify then generalize
    * ransom note characters then words

## BCR Best Conceivable Runtime

* The minimum runtime, where any lesser time would generate wrong time.

## Notes

* Sometime Big O of an algorithm isn't one of the common big Os

# Dynamic Programming / Memoization [OK]

* Fibonacci , if( memo[n] ==0) else return memo[n]

# Sorting

* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1735863/merge-sort-java
* Merge Sort
* Quick sort

# Searching

* Breadth first search
* Depth first search
* Binary search
